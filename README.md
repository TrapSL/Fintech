# VATraveler Solutions

## The project

**VATraveler Solutions** is a company that aims to simplify the process of VAT refunds in the European Union. Our innovative idea
can lead in an increase of spending by tourists, beniefiting the market, while it will also creather a smoother experience for
the tourists, helping them leave the continent with a more positive feeling.

## Requirements
In order to use the service, the user will just have to use the website, which is still under construction. As for the technical side,
all the required libraries are described in the actual code. Apart from that, the newest version of Python and either VScode or Anaconda
are recommended.

## Usage
The project is not fully operational yet, so only a few aspects of it are fully operational. The main issue that was tackled was the process
of uploading images by the end user, and this can be done easily in the first batch of code. The remaining part mostly focused on the 
steps that need to be followed and provides a rough code of them.
